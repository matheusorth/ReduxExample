First usage of Redux architecture. Used one exercise (below) for implementation.

## Exercise

Simple iOS-App with UITableView and two buttons.
Left Button: Creates a new producer.
Right Button: Creates a new consumer.

Producer: adds a cell every 3 seconds.
Consumer: removes a cell every 4 seconds.
A created producer/consumer will never be removed and will do its job forever.

The user can create producer or consumer how often he wants by clicking the specified buttons.
